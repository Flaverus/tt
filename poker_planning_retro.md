# User Story Estimation

## Pre-Requirements
1. **Milestones** are defined.
2. **User stories** are created and assigned to milestones.
3. **Tasks** are created based on their user stories and linked to them.

## Estimation Process

### Overall Preparation Process
1. Open the user story to be estimated.
2. Start a Planning Poker session: [https://planningpokeronline.com/EbYXxZKhKtapUkuYqS8m/](https://planningpokeronline.com/EbYXxZKhKtapUkuYqS8m/)
3. Add tasks from the two user stories to the Poker session.
4. All tasks will be estimated by the team based on their **complexity**.

### First User Story: Get Temperature Trend

The tasks for the user story **"Feat: Get temperature trend"** ([GitLab Issue #1](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/issues/1)) will be estimated.

1. **Frontend: Add Diagram** ([Work Item #10](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/work_items/10))
    * Estimates are hidden from the team until everyone has voted.
    * Estimates revealed: Lowest 3 (Michel) / Highest 21 (Anna).
    * **Discussion:** The wide range of estimates was due to different opinions on how elaborate the diagram should be. The team discussed the scope and reached a consensus.
    * **Final Estimate:** The values in the next round were in the range of 5 and 8, with **8** winning the vote.

2. **Frontend: Add Button** ([Work Item #9](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/work_items/9))
    * Estimates: Low 1 / High 3. The team assumed that the backend and required requests would already be in place.
    * **Next Round:** The new estimates were 2 and 3, with **3** winning the vote.

3. **Backend: Provide Endpoint** ([Work Item #7](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/work_items/7))
    * Estimates: 8 and 13, with **13** winning the vote.

### Second User Story: Display Current Temperature

The tasks for the user story **"Feat: Display current temperature"** ([GitLab Issue #3](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/issues/3)) will be estimated.

1. **Design: UI Design for the Frontend as Guideline** ([Work Item #11](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/work_items/11))
    * Estimates: 3 and 8. The team discussed that this design would serve as a template for all future web pages.
    * **Next Round:** The new estimates were 5 and 8, with **8** winning the vote.

2. **Backend: Define an API** ([Work Item #6](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/work_items/6))
    * Estimates: 8 and 13, with **13** winning the vote.

3. **Frontend: UI Component** ([Work Item #5](https://gitlab.switch.ch/hslu/edu/bachelor-engineering-and-architecture/tsm_softweng/tsm_softweng_aut25/group-4/temperature-tracker/-/work_items/5))
    * Estimates: 3 and 5, with **5** winning the vote.

### Conclusion
* All tasks will be estimated by the team based on their **complexity**.
* The estimated values for the tasks were calculated and added as a comment to their respective user stories. This was done as a comment since weighted estimation is a premium feature of GitLab.
* Added DoD (Defintion of Done) for better understanding.
* The difference between the estimations shows that there are misunderstandings of the scope of the story.
